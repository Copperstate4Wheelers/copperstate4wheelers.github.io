This is a campout from July 4th through July 7th. We'll setup camp and do a few
runs on the days between. If you prefer not to camp, you can drive out and join
us during the day for a run, just let us know so we wait for you to arrive
before starting the day.

Meeting location: contact Jim for details, but the campsite will be near

Typically, the easiest path to this campsite is by first travelling to the
Maverik on 40 (see the map below), then following the forest roads down. Contact
Jim for a gpx file if you prefer.
