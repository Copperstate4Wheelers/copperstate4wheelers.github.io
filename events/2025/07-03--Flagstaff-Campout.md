title: Flagstaff Campout/Run
time: TBA
invite: Members Only
---

## Requirements

* 4x4
* GMRS
* camping gear, food, etc.. for however many nights you'll stay (if any)


## Additional Info

Multiple club members will camp through the holiday weekend. We'll do at least
one club run if you wish to join for the run without camping.

In the past, we've had members who wished to join for multiple days but did not
want to camp. They were able to find hotels in Flagstaff and drive out to join
us.

The campsite has room for trailers/RVs, but the road in can be challenging for
very large RVs.

## Meeting Location

> _35.10093,-111.82313_

**DO NOT** follow GPS instructions if you are travelling to the campsite from Phoenix. The easiest way to the campsite is to drive up to the Maverik on 40 and drive south towards the campsite. Contact Jim for a GPX track if you are unsure.
