          <h3>Day Trips</h3>
          <p>
            Day trips are the most common activity the Copperstate 4 Wheelers
            do. A typical day unfolds like this: first, we meet at a familiar
            location near the trailhead; next, we find the trail and air down;
            finally, we run the trail, often finishing sometime in the afternoon
            or evening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Day trips are typically open to guests. Ultimately it's up to the
            trip leader to decide, so always check the event listing!

          <h3>Overlanding</h3>
          <p>
            We usually fit in a few overlanding trips each year. These take more
            preparation and planning and are always a blast. Many of our members
            enjoy camping in trailers or full-sized RVs when possible, while
            others prefer roughing it in tents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multi-day trips are typically members-only as we like to be familiar
            with who we'll spend so much time with.

          <h3>Night Runs</h3>
          <p>
            Night runs are a rare alternative to day trips. When we do these,
            it's usually in the summer as a way to beat the heat in the valley.
            A night run usually starts around sunset and finishes well into the
            night. We select runs that offer a good view of the city. It's
            always a blast to overcome the challenge of navigating off-road in
            the dark.
          </p>
