The club will camp near the Edge Of The World in the Coconino National Forest
near Flagstaff. We've camped around here on the 4th of July the last few years
and it has always been a lot of fun. We will probably hit the nearby trails
on multiple days during the weekend, but the official Club Run will be on
Saturday if you prefer only to come up for the day.

More details to come!
