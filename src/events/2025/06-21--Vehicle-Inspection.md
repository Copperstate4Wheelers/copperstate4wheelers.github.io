## More Information

The club meets about once a year to do a group vehicle inspection where we
split into groups and inspect the major systems on each vehicle. It's not
anything formal, but it is a great way to catch things that may need maintenence
and to learn about your vehicle.

You do not need to be a mechanical expert to be helpful!
