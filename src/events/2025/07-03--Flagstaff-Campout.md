Multiple club members will camp through the holiday weekend.

We will be wheeling Friday if just coming up for the day get to the campsite and ready to leave by 10am.

Come up for however long you want, but please let Jim know if you do. We will watch for you and/or head out early once we have everyone. Cell service is very spotty and we will be on GMRS Channel 7.

Some of us are going up Wednesday and coming home Sunday.


### Requirements

* [Normal required gear](/about/required-gear)
* camping gear, food, etc.. for however many nights you'll stay (if any)
* State Trust Permit for some of the off-road travel

### Meeting Location

**DO NOT** follow GPS instructions if you are travelling to the campsite from Phoenix.

The best way to get there, if you go to the Maverik Gas station at 1690 W Rte 66, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 and follow the link it will lead you to the camping location. The trip from here to the campsite is 12.7 miles of which 9 is a gravel/dirt road, not bad has a little washboard as of last year. This is RV Friendly.
