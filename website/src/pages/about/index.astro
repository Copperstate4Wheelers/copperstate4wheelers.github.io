      This club was formed and incorporated March 31, 1972
      by a group of families to promote safe enjoyable
      family style 4 wheeling. We operate as a non-profit
      dues paying club with elected officers and democratic
      participation by all members families. No member
      receives pay for time spent on behalf of the club. Our
      club by-laws are operating documents are available
      from the club president, or the secretary on request.
      Our club meets to carry out the routine club business,
      plan activities, and develop or discuss new ideas.
      This meeting is limited to one hour by our by-laws. At
      least one club sponsored trip is available each month.
      The time and date of these trips are discussed at our
      monthly meetings and will be posted on the calendar
      page. Each trip or outing is planned by a club member
      who is referred to as the trail leader or his trip or
      outing. The trail leader is in charge of, but not
      responsible for each person who attends the trip or
      outing. This club is dedicated to the premise that our
      environment and our outdoor heritage must be
      protected, therefore the willful destruction of
      private or public property or the needless
      disfigurement of our land will not be tolerated.
      Guests as well as members are expected to be
      conscientious in this respect leaving nothing on a
      trip but a few tire tracks.

      Our club is very proud to announce we have adopted the
      Bulldog Canyon OHV area and periodically visit the
      area through the year often working with TRAL or the
      Tonto National Forest.
